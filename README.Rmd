# satellites

<!-- badges: start -->

The `satellites` package was created to provide a simple research tool for those interested in learning about the satellites in Earth's orbit (as of March 31, 2020).  The data, which comes from the [Union of Concerned Scientists](https://www.ucsusa.org/resources/satellite-database), represents the 

* what kind of data is there
* how they update it
* how long they've had it for 
* how this can be used
* why I took those variables and pushed the two data sets together

The goal of   `satellites is to 

Provide one data set altogether with a sampling of X vars.  Y observations.
Total vars = ...



## Installation

You can install the released version of satellites from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` r
install.packages("satellites")
```

And the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("nfrontero20/satellites")
```
## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(satellites)
## basic example code
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub!
